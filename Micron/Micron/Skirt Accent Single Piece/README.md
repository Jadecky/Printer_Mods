# Single Piece Skirt Accent for Micron R1

As the title suggests — a single piece side skirt accent for a cleaner look, increased rigidity, and fewer printed parts.

Uses the same mounting hardware as stock.

**Pro Tip:** I recommend VHB'ing all skirt accents to the bottom panel — makes removal much easier when working in the electronics bay.
