## 🔧 Overview  
A compact, rigid mount designed for **[AntHead](https://github.com/PrintersForAnts/AntHead) & Nighthawk36 (NH36)** toolhead PCB.  
It provides six solid mounting points and integrated standoffs to increase rigidity of the board, and reduce strain on the umbilical connection.

## 🧼 Features  
- 🪛 **Six points of contact**, including the rear of the X-carriage for increased stability.  
- 🔄 **Two versions available** — one for NH36 boards with tabs, and one for when tabs are removed.  
- 🧱 **Supports both 18 mm and 20 mm standoffs**, 18mm to increase clearance to the Z-Chain on Micron R1.   
- 🔌 **Built-in standoffs and support ribs** for both the NH36 board and the main plug/socket — improving overall stability and umbilical cable security.
