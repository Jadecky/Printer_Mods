# 🧽 Micron+ Nozzle Scrubber & Purge Bucket  
### *Because even your nozzle deserves a spa day.*

![Overall View](Images/Overall.png)

Keep your nozzle tidy and your purge blobs contained with this magnetic bucket and silicone scrubber combo — easy to install, easy to empty, and deeply satisfying to use.

Now available with the silicone brush on right (original) or left. Placing it on the left reduces any fouling of the toolhead on the Z Chain.
Thanks to `@vince M.213` for the suggestion to have the new brush on the left variant. 

There is also a different version of the Bucket, and Brush holder for LDO kits as they come with 15mm standoffs for the bed rather than M4 Knurled nuts. 

**IMPORTANT** If using the brush on the left variant, you will need to adjust the co-ordinates in the provided macros if you are using them.
