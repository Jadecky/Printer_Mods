# Z Belt Clamp for Micron

Nothing groundbreaking â€” just a simple belt clamp to tidy up the Z belts on your Micron+. Keeps your Z belts neat and prevents them from flapping around inside the frame.

*Quick, easy print. Simple install.*

Remixed from the original [Voron Variant](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/ChenTheDesignMaker/Z_Belt_Clip), by ChentheDesignMaker, to include a Micron Logo instead.
